Known Limitations
-----------------

The following are known limitations that cannot be fixed, due to the Fusion add-in interface.

- :kbd:`{` and :kbd:`}` cannot be entered in string inputs in Fusion on keyboards where they require :kbd:`AltGr` to be pressed.

  - Workaround is to use the :guilabel:`{}` buttons in the dialog.

- The mouse pointer must be moved before clicking on the same sketch text again, to do a second select/unselect.

- ``_.file`` does not update on file rename/copy.

  - Workaround is to open the *Change Text Parameters* dialog and click :guilabel:`OK`, in the new document.
